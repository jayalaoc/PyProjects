    "This approach is, however, still breakable - it just takes a lot of clever analysis and number crunching. During World War II, Alan Turing, having already at that point done fundamental work developing the very concept of a digital computer, developed machines and algorithms to try to break the German Enigma code, eventually managing to decode it with his team at Bletchley Park.\n",

    "Cracking this code was a huge development in the war - it is estimated this code breaking work, which allowed the Allies to decode messages and anticipate German actions, may have shortened the war by up 2 to 3 years, saving millions of lives in the process.\n",

    "By the early 1950s, though his codebreaking work was still strictly confidential and he was largely unknown by the general public, Alan Turing had gone on to make other huge contributions to the fields of computation and artificial intelligence, amongst others, that would go on to have massive impact on the modern world. \n",
