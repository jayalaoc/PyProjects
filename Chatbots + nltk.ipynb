    "### Chatbots: Words & Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do these kinds of chatbots work? Most broadly, they combine two simple but powerful approaches:\n",
    "- Rule Based Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI)\n",
    "- Bag-Of-Word Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule based AI**, sometimes called 'Good Old Fashion Artificial Intelligence', or 'GOFAI', is an approach to making artificial agents that tries to write down a set of rules to follow to perform some task. In practice, this often looks like using a lot of conditionals: if `X` happens, do `Y`. If we can write down enough logical procedures (call them algorithms) to follow to complete some task, then we can create an artificially intelligent agent (for that task).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag-Of-Word language models** are an approach to language that takes the simple approach of saying 'lets try and figure out what someone is saying simply by checking and counting which words they use'. If someone says the word 'dog' three times in conversation, they are probably talking about dogs. This ignores many many things about language, and how it works, but is a good 'first guess' for what is being said. \n",
    "\n",
    "From our perspective, this means two things:\n",
    "- We can broadly try to figure out the topic simply by checking which words are used\n",
    "- We can choose a response based on a rule that defines what to do if and when we identify particular topics\n",
    "\n",
    "In code then, this looks like:\n",
    "- taking input as strings of continuous text, and splitting this up into lists that contain all the words we see\n",
    "- use conditionals (if/elif/else) that choose an output based on what words appear in those lists\n",
    "\n",
    "As we work through and create all the function in the next section to create our chatbot, try to think through how these functions relate to this approach."
